# ReadTrack: Your Personal Bookshelf in the Cloud

## Product Vision Statement

To empower book enthusiasts by creating a dynamic and engaging online platform that revolutionizes the way users discover, organize, and share their reading experiences. Our vision is to launch a user-friendly web app that offers instant access to a comprehensive book database, enables personalized book management through 'Currently Reading', 'Want to Read', and 'Finished Reading' lists, and fosters a community of readers who can explore and connect over shared literary interests. By releasing an MVP that encapsulates the core functionalities of profile customization, book list management, and user interaction, we aim to quickly gather feedback for iterative enhancements, ensuring our solution not only meets but exceeds the evolving needs of our audience.

## Instructions

- instructions for building and testing the project (update with that information once the project reaches that stage)
  The project's wireframe is developed using Figma. The project's front-end is developed using ReactJs and TailwindCSS.
- To test (putting here for now, move later): first run
   ```npm install chai@4 chai-http@4 --save-dev```
   then run
   ```npm test```

## Product Development

- a short history of how the project came to be and information about how to contribute to the project (i.e. a link to the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) document)
  [Sprints]

1. See the [App Map & Wireframes](instructions-0a-app-map-wireframes.md) and [Prototyping](./instructions-0b-prototyping.md) instructions for the requirements of the initial user experience design of the app.
   During Sprint 0 the team convened virtually to discuss the different pages we believe our application would need. We created a list of these pages then distributed the p ages for each team member to work on the wireframes for. Afterwards we connected all of the pages so that buttons on one page may link to another page so that the wireframe would be ready to present to shareholders.

1. See the [Sprint Planning instructions](instructions-0d-sprint-planning.md) for the requirements of Sprint Planning for each Sprint.
   During Sprint 1 the team convened (both virtually and in-person) on multiple occasions to establish, discuss, and check-in on the different parts of the front-end that needed to be created. The team began by taking the previously created user stories and transforming them into tasks. These tasks were then distributed across Github's project board into columns labeled "Todo," "In Progress," and "Complete." After creating the tasks, team members each selected 3-5 tasks to focus on throughout the sprint.

1. See the [Front-End Development instructions](./instructions-1-front-end.md) for the requirements of the initial Front-End Development.
   During Sprint 2 the team convened virtually and in-person to discuss and review work done on the front end. The front end was initially developed to closely resemble the wireframe but was later configured to have a more user-friendly aesthetic.

1. See the [Back-End Development instructions](./instructions-2-back-end.md) for the requirements of the initial Back-End Development.
   During Sprint 3 the team convened virtually, mostly via discord, to discuss which pages of the website each team member should focus on to change from static to dynamic.

1. See the [Database Integration instructions](./instructions-3-database.md) for the requirements of integrating a database into the back-end.

1. See the [Deployment instructions](./instructions-4-deployment.md) for the requirements of deploying an app.
